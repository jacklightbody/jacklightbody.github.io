My first year out of college was disorienting. For years I had experienced time in terms of well defined semesters, and measured my growth on a rubric defined by others like grades. But now I was left adrift, without any natural markers.

I don't think I even realized this for a long time. Until my lease came up. But then it hit me that I had been in Seattle for a full year. And like all anniversaries, it forced me to evaluate what I had done. I'd moved to a new city, started a new job, and made some friends. But then after that first crazy month or two? Not much. All the crazy nights out and  tough hikes and tasty food blurred into each other, leaving a vague happy fogâ€” but nothing concrete, no lasting growth. 

Setting goals for myself has helped me remedy that. My first goal was to run a marathon. My second was to find a new job. Tangible, achievable things to build towards. 

Becoming a better writer is my next goal. I'm a huge believer in the power of written words, and would love to produce as well as consume. Following the spirit of NaNoWriMo feels like a good place to start- writing every day for a month. We'll see how it goes.
