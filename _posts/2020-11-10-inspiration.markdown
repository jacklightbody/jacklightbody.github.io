Choosing what to write about for this challenge was a challenge in and of itself. I also considered several options— doing a true NaNoWriMo and writing a novel, creating a series of prompt inspired short stories, and writing a sort of diary. 

I decided on that fiction stories might improve my fiction writing, but not necessarily my ability to communicate myself. Certainly it would be a by-product, but as a secondary muscle group rather than the primary. And I think I'm not quite removed enough from middle-school yet to be a boy writing a diary. So blogging it was. 

The next worry was whether I would have enough topics to write about. I started brainstorming a couple weeks in advance, jotting down a quick word or two on topics that I thought would be interesting. Rather akin a squirrel hoarding acorns for winter. But just like a squirrel might lose its nuts, I've found my stored up ideas unhelpful. Instead, random thoughts that popped in just before writing have been the seed of most posts. 

Perhaps I have pondered the stored up posts so much that they have become stale and uninteresting. The few posts that I have written based on them have all gone in a completely different direction than I'd previously sketched out. Unembellished, they all lack the brightness of a fresh thought. 

So often my writing has gone in a different direction than intended. Which I suppose is rather the point of practicing writing. My only worry is that I tend to meander back towards familiar ground without guidelines to follow. Too often posts end with some grand intellectual thought. Which is likely a by-product of years of schooling teaching me to sum up all your thoughts and provide a final burst of comprehensive insight. 

So maybe I need to write with even more freedom? Forget all the rules I've learned? It's unclear. But either way, I would like to work on my endings.
