I found myself missing my commute the other day. Having a separation between work and life to shift mindsets in. A period to rid myself of any worries from work.

Granted, it was a relatively benign commute. An hourlong car ride would be another beast entirely. But my 30 minute walk or 15 minute bike was a peaceful ritual. I could follow the hill down in the morning and work off any frustrations climbing it back in the afternoon.

I've always enjoyed that physical gulf. The quarter mile between the bus stop and my house offered a sanctuary, not quite school and not quite home. Likewise, while I was never productive in my college dorm, walking a couple blocks to the student center or math building was always a reliable way to tilt my head into the right state of mind. 

But the 20 feet between my bed and laptop has been my commute for months now. Some days it suffices, others it fails miserably. The transition after work tends to be smoother, as I typically go for a run to offer the same phyiscal relief. But the morning can be tricky.

Many mornings I find it easier not lingering in the shower or over breakfast and instead jumping straight in. Probably because it means that I only have to switch from sleeping to working mode, rather than adding in a relaxing step. I'm not sure how sustainable that will be long term. But hopefully I can start walking in to work again before it becomes a real issue.
