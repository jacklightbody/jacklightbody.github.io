Liquor stores are adult candy shops as far as in concerned. Rows of brightly labeled products that look oh so tantalizing. And unlike candy shops there's no adult restraining you from the objects of your affection. Which is how I sometimes end up walking out with my own body weight in beer. 

Keeping myself in check is especially difficult because it can be so hard to choose the right beer. I know types of beers that I like, but beers often seem to be tagged by the brewer after a quality testing a few, and can vary pretty wildly. So if I want to explore something new I'm left at a loss. And every time I look up beer reviews online I can feel my annoying hipster-stache growing as a sort of modern pinocchio. So I frequently choose the most interesting looking label or cleverest name as a way to escape all that. 

I'm rarely actually unhappy with the beer that I chose, but who knows if a different pack could've been even tastier. Its one of the few real life opportunity costs that I have to deal with regularly, and one that I frequently struggle with. What a first-world problem. 

Thankfully, I find most of the IPAs that fill up half of the shelf to be generally gross, and so can ignore that whole section. But there are still typically tens of other beers to choose between. Pick-sixes can be great, but I always fear that I'll fall in love with one of the beers and the other five will leave me feeling unrequited. But occasionally it feels like the only way to experience the full range of suds on offer.

Really the only hard rule is never choose a four-pack. Those are just a scam.
