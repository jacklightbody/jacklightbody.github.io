I have been staying in an AirBnb for almost 4 full months as part of this grand road trip, across 7 different rentals. My stays have ranged from a handful of days to over a month, spread between familiar stopping grounds in Seattle and random cottages outside Joshua Tree.

Yet each stop seems to derive from the previous one. It's as if there is a shared repository of ginormous shampoo bottles for the bathroom, knives abandoned by a sharpener for just a little too long, and remotes with millions of inscrutable buttons from which they all draw. 

I don't mean to be criticizing these stays, rather they all seem to be signs of a space that is well loved. I'm sure a stranger stumbling into my own apartment would find it much the same. We tend to become used to the sharp edges in our own environs until they seem to vanish away. 

But by virtue of moving around so frequently, I've made it impossible for myself to adapt to these tendencies. Just as I become accustomed to one places peculiarities I am moving again, and doubly jarred by the slightly different inconveniences. 

At the beginning of this trip I'd wondered if I would adapt to this, become so completely unmoored that I would have no expectations walking into a new space. But I can confidently say that has not happened. I will glom on anywhere in an effort to call it home, even if I know that it's only home until tomorrow.
