I am rapidly approaching the halfway mark of this challenge. It's pretty startling how quickly it has gone so far. Though maybe it shouldn't by given how time seems to speed up every year. Especially with how blurry time is during this pandemicâ€” the whole year seems to have a sort of fog over it, one week seamlessly blending into the next.

I generally like using milestones to break up projects. Bite sized pieces feel much more achievable, and the boost you feel from finishing one helps push you on towards the next. When I was running the marathon my goal was always the next mile marker, and when I finished one I would try and calculate what percent of the total I had finished and what my pace was. By the time I finished computing all that, I'd generally be well on the way towards checking another mile off.

I haven't really done so for this goal though. I think in part because I recognize that the NaNoWriMo portion is really just a milestone itself. I won't have magically become a perfect writer by the end of this month, but writing for a month will help me do whatever I want to do next. So the halfway mark feels even less of a milestone. 

I do need to start pondering what my next step will be though, so hitting halfway is a useful reminder of that. I want to keep my writing momentum going, and having a concrete next step seems the best way to do so. I've had a couple of thoughts down that path already, but nothing solid yet. Things to think about for sure.
