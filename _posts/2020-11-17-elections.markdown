The election was called for Biden over a week ago now. Yet Trump still has not conceded, nor has much of the Senior Republican leadership. During this week, I've spent several hours digging into Trumps twitter feed. I'm not sure what I expect to find- at this point I don't really expect an admission of the loss until he's forced. 

Many of his tweets are rambling and incoherent. Yet the agenda he pushes is compelling. After scrolling for a few minutes I find myself half-believing in some grand scandal perpetuated by Democrats, the media, and just about everyone who isn't one of his ardent supporters. 

Beyond just not admitting fault, Trump seems to double down on every dubious statement. This behavior seems so unthinkable that the simplest explanation, the one I seized on, is that he is telling the truth.

A few quick googles certainly remedied that impression. But if I was more predisposed to believe him? Or even to disbelieve the media? It seems emminently possible that I would have bought it at face value.

As many tv shows will say, never admitting you're wrong sometimes seems to be an American virtue. A cheap joke, sure, but one that I've always previously laughed at. But when it conflicts with real Democracy in action- an actual American virtueâ€” it seems in awfully poor taste.
