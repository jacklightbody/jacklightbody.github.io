I’ve worked out almost every single day of 2020. Often multiple times a day. In fact, I’m reasonable confident that I will have worked out more times this year than ever before. 

This is not to say that I’m in my best shape ever. Marathon training and a soccer pre-seasons both sculpted my body more. Because in those cases I was actively building up to something, stretching my limits every day.

My workouts this year have been nowhere near as grueling. In fact, thats partly the point. This year workouts are one of my only ways to go outside safely. Which I desperately need to get rid of excess energy and as a coping mechanism. So I have kept my workouts very light, remaining well inside my physical boundaries so that I stay healthy to go out again tomorrow. 

That turns out to mean lots of 2-3 mile runs and light body-weight workouts. I've come to enjoy these shorter workouts, and a half-hour block is certainly easier to find than the 2+ hours that some of my marathon workouts required. These light exercises are especially nice after work as a quick way to destress and distance myself. 

Still, I miss the feeling of reaching the edge and finding I have just a little bit more in reserve. So I can't wait for the first workout where I can really let it all out. I'm going to absolutely savor every second of muscle burn and every gasping breath.
