Completely losing yourself in a book is one of my favorite feelings. My ears might as well fall off from how little I process, and my eyes blur out anything beyond the rectangle in the forefront of my vision. Finally putting the book down often feels like waking up from a dream, reality slowly eroding the world I constructed.

When I do come to, I frequently find myself completely upside down with my head on the ground, or with a bright pink imprint of a fist on my cheek from resting on it for hours. Not the most graceful of positions. My first few steps afterwards are always halting as blood flows back into my limbs.

This has almost become a measuring stick for me. When I wake with an especially painful crick in my back I know that it must be a truly excellent book. And it makes me that much more excited to jump back in later.

Unlike most metrics, it doesn't seem to fall subject to Goodhart's Law. Conciously making myself uncomfortable to try and enjoy a book more spews me out of the pages and back into reality, it isn't something that I can force at all. 

I can't imagine setting all goals in a similar fashion, some seem too difficult to associate with a negative first step. But I do wonder if some goals could be manipulated into a similar scenario where the short term is more painful and the long term far more rewarding. If so, it would certainly stop some of the gamification that tends to plague large bureaucracies.
