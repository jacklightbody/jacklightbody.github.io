Growing up in a tiny New Hampshire village meant being far from everything. My town had a general store with milk and chips, a post office, and a small library offshoot. If you wanted anything else you had to drive into the next town over for it. 

There were really only two roads to get into town. By the end of high school I could drive them with my eyes closed. I effectively did some mornings given my typically teenage malaise before noon. Even now I could probably recite every dip and turn.

Living in a city hasn't really changed that though. I would typically use the same one or two streets to get to work every morning or to walk to the bars or to go for a run. Even though I had more choices, I still made the same decisions. There was a brief trial and error period initially, but once I figured out the most optimal paths I stuck to them. 

This seems unavoidable to a certain degree. I am abolutely a creature of habit, and these automatic reactions help avoid decision fatigue. And most days I truly do want the quickest route between points A and B. 

Travelling has been a wonderful way to prevent myself  from ever forming into a habit. Only being in a city for a month prevents me from ever truly settling in my ways. It can absolutely be exhausting. But it's also really enjoyable to feel like I'm exploring with every street corner I pass.
