I've learned a ton since starting my new job. I knew next to nothing about venture capital when I joined, and had last done full-stack work almost 4 years ago. So everything that I once knew was out of date. As a result I've spent hours every week poring over articles and past discussions, trying to clean every last scrap of knowledge that I can. 

Unsurprisingly, not every tidbit is as useful as others, with some pieces yielding an instant understanding while others are intractably dense even after reading through a fifth time. This tends to vary roughly in lock-step with the intricacy of information that is being conveyed. But there are certainly some exceptions where the author perfectly encapsulates and distills a concept down into such basic parts that anyone could understand them.

Having written a fair bit of documentation myself, I know how hard this is to accomplish. In many ways it's a challenge akin to editing. The writer must be an expert on the subject matter to write accurate information, but must also be able to see the problem without the built-up context of an expert to ensure that outsiders can understand it. Thus as the topic becomes more complex, the author must be further divorced from a beginner and less able to view the writing through that lens.

The ideal time to create documentation then is immediately after acquiring knowledge of it, when any initial confusions are still at the forefront of your memory. But I tend to be far more likely to do whatever thing required me to grasp this knowledge in the first place rather than to write it out. After all, I've already wasted enough time learning this, now I want to actually use it.

Ingesting massive tracts of new information has proved to be a decent forcing mechanism for me in my new job. I'm learning so many new things a day that not everything quite makes it to my long term memory, so if I don't write it down straight away I'm likely to lose it. I'm not sure how to keep this as a forcing mechanism long term though, other than hoping that this frantic phase will force me to make a habit of it.
