At this time of year everyone wants to fight back against the dwindling sun. Every window radiates out, the lights within proof of such abundant joy and merriment that it spills out onto the street. At least thats how I choose to view it.

Often the character of the lights hints at the scene inside. Austere white bulbs suggest an elegance and restrained beauty, while rainbow strings allude to  unbridled enthusiasm. Even office parks with harsh white light shining on ornaments hung up by a festive cubicle dweller have their own characters. All beautiful in their own way.

The combination of snow and firelight is by far my favorite illumination though. Resting by the side of a cherry red blaze, gazing at a pristine new coat of white. The contrast of icy cold outside and slow warmth inside. It feels like a tonic for the soul.

Of course, it doesn't snow very frequently in Southern California. And most apartment buildings don't allow open fires. But that almost makes everyone try all the harder to create an air of holiday spirit. It makes every effort seem imbued with even more love and care. Even making palm trees feel like christmas trees.
