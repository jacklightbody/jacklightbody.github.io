At this time of year everyone wants to fight back against the dwindling sun and express holiday joy all in one. So every window radiates outwards, proof of such abundant joy and merriment that it spills out onto the street. At least thats how I choose to view it.

Often the character of the lights hints at the scene inside. Austere white bulbs suggest an elegance and restrained beauty, while rainbow strings hint of more spontaneity and unbridled enthusiasm. Even office parks with harsh white light shining on ornaments hung up by a festive cubicle dweller. Each beautiful in their own way.

The combination of snow and firelight is by far my favorite illumination though. Resting by the side of a cheery red blaze, gazing at its reflection on a pristine new coat. The contrast of icy cold outside and slow warmth inside. It feels like a tonic for the soul.

Of course, it doesn't snow very frequently in Southern California. And most apartment buildings don't allow open fires. But that almost makes everyone try all the harder to mimic it here, to create some vestige of holiday spirit depite it not being a storybook setting. It makes every effort seem imbued with even more love and care. Which seems even more in keeping with the spirit.
