Beginning often seems impossible. Even activities I enjoy like working out seem horrid when I'm curled up on a warm comfortable couch. So running an annoying errand? Forget about it. Unfortunately, I am an adult. So I occasionally do need to stay on hold for half an hour to talk to someone, or deep clean my apartment.

Unavoidable cases that have a firm deadline are generally easier. Just like procrastinating on a school project, I'm eventually forced to find time and to make progress on them. And once I've started the task always feels more manageable.

But other tasks can be delayed or cancelled entirely. I could not go for a run today, or live in squalor for a few months. There would be consequences, but sometimes those tradeoffs feel reasonable compared to actually getting off my butt.

The most effective method I've found for these is to do the smallest possible step, generally just getting ready for whatever it is. Putting on rubber gloves to clean the bathroom or pair of workout shorts. Once I have those on I can then go back to the couch. But sitting around in such an odd outfit is generally enough inducement to get off my butt.

I'm really not sure why starting is so difficult. Why activities always seem more forboding from the outside. But at least I'm aware of it and can take steps to counter.
