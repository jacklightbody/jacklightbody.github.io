One thing that’s already surprised me about this writing is that I don’t know my audience. That’s not strictly true— it’s my girlfriend and family (the only ones to who'll actually read this). But still. My audience could be anyone with an internet connection, at least in theory. 

I don’t think I’ve ever written a faceless person before. It’s liberating and a bit intimidating. I can’t know how their own background has shaped how they will take my opinions. There’s not necessarily any shared ground between us. Instead, it’s my job as the writer to make them feel that shared connection, that spark of empathy. 

As it turns out, I’m really not sure how to do that. I think all I can do is be as honest and candid as possible, and hope that my basic humanness shines through. Any other way would seem like pandering.

Maybe I’m approaching this from too analytical a world view though. Maybe creators just create, and then accept that some people will like it, and some won’t. 

I’m not fully convinced by that though. After all, lots of sequels are accused of pandering too much to fans. So I have to believe that creators are aware of the communities that they create and their feelings. And in that case, the work that they do to actively find and cultivate groups of like-minded fans should be commended. Even if the actual content is as inane as an instagram influencers ad posts.
