The end of muggy afternoon soccer practices always seemed to hint of danger. Not a ton, but enough to get my stomach quivering. Poor practices would increase the dread until I could practically see the pain on the horizon, feel my lungs gasping and muscles burning from the conditioning that was sure to follow. My coach calling on us to line up at the endline would almost be a relief, at least the dread was gone.

After a few exhausting minutes, he would generally offer us a carrot— five more sets, and if we finish the last in 30 seconds and we're done. Otherwise we keep going. Pretty standard coach speak. But he would also warn us. If we slacked on any of the four sets before the timed one, didn't give it our all each and every time, then we would run until we dropped. No gaming the system to only try when it counts, since you can't know when it counts in a game, each attack could be the last.

I've taken that advice with me ever since. Sayings like "It isn't how you start it's how you finish" ignore that you need to be in position to succeed at the end. If you've truly given everything, there won't be any energy for a heroic last sprint to the line. It'll all be behind you, and stumbling across at your current pace will be enough of a challenge.

I definitely feel like I'm stumbling across the line with writing. I've been stumped for ideas many days late in this month, and have spent far more time gazing at a document with no idea where to go next. In some ways this reassures me that NaNoWriMo was a good goal, challenging me as any goal should. But in other ways this is dissapointing— I've only written for a month, and it's hardly been the most incisive or beautiful writing. I guess I was hoping for more, even if that was unrealistic.

I'm planning to take a few days off before diving back into editing, and hopefully at that point will have some outside context to look back and fairly judge this month. I'm glad to have tried this format, but may need to do something completely different to continue on my writing journey. Still, I made it to the line, and did so while truly trying the whole time.
