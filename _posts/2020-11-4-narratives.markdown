Like many Americans, I spent last night huddled around the TV watching election results come in. I clung desperately to every new piece of information parcelled out. Even as it became clear that there would be no definitive answer tonight, I desperately concotted tales to explain the seemingly random vote counts. 

Yes, natural selection trained us to spot patterns out of chaos. But now there is no jaguar to spot amongst the leaves. And yet by evolutions whims we remain tethered to patterns and narratives as a sort of vestigial third-eye.

What's more, once we spot a pattern emerging we are loathe to concede it. even in the face of overwhelming evidence. Such is the comfort that having any sort of rationalization offers us.

However, occasionally we are able to break past those barriers. We realize that rather than having a bad day, we simply had two unfortunate things happen, for two moments of the day. And that there are boundless opportunities for the rest of the day to right whatever wrong we've experienced. 

I'd almost liken such experiences to lucid dreaming. It feels as if you have broken out of a box- a box of your own making, but a box nonetheless. The possibilities are endless for how you will experience your day, and you are the one who gets to decide everything.

Of course, eventually you do go back inside that box. You retire for the night and forget exactly how being untethered feels, and the box is cozy and safe and there's really no need to leave. Which only makes it more magical the next time you do escape.
