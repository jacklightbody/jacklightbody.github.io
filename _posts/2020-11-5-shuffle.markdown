Call me old fashioned, but I have an iTunes library. It's got about 2,000 songs in it, across all different genres and periods of my life. I've tried a couple of times to switch to Spotify or some other cloud based service, but just never found them compelling enough to switch. So instead I have a whole bunch of physical mp3 files sitting around on my harddrive.

I have a couple smart playlists for songs I've added in the past year, but pretty much nothing beyond that. So the vast majority of my songs are just in a blob together. I do occassionally look up a specific artist or song, but I far more frequently hit the shuffle button and see what comes up. 

I'll lean back and listen to a middle school era angsty rock song next to a pop anthem next to a Jack Johnson song. Discongruous for sure. But if I'm plugging away at some work I might not even realize that the song has changed. 

If I'm listening to a Pandora radio though, I immediately notice song changes. The songs Pandora suggests are much closer to the source. But they stand out by virtue of their newness, the song boundary a sharp shiny edge rather than a well-scuffed slope. 

This seems to mimic a lot of how we view the world- known vs. unknown. No matter how much the known varies, it is still safer and more comfortable than the other.
