The hardest part of writing every day has been finding time for it every single day. Planning out my days to know when I have windows of free time. And when those windows do come, I know that I actually have to be productive, because there might not be an opportunity later.

This structure was a staple of my childhood. I was constantly rushing around between practices with my school backpack or smuggling a headlamp onto the bus back from a later soccer game to work on my assignments. So I’ve welcomed this pattern back as a long-lost friend. 

One thing I hadn’t noticed as a kid is how such a scattered schedule effects output. But the contrast is striking after a couple years of working from 9-5 every day. At some hours the words flow through my fingers and onto the screen like lightning, impossible to control or predict. And other times I have to cajole each word through a 3-car pileup, carefully planning the route. 

This timing driven writers block feels entirely predictable in a sense. Of course it will be harder to switch over to a writing mindset immediately following a full day of work. But if that’s the only free time that day, then it’s the only option. Setting aside time during the most effective hours means really prioritizing the work. With such a demanding hobby it's no wonder many people struggle to write their novel.
