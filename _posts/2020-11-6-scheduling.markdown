Writing every day requires finding time for it every single day. Which means planning out my days so that I know what windows of free time I have. It’s also a forcing mechanism to get me to actually produce during those stints if I don’t have a later opportunity. 

Such structure was a staple of my childhood. I was constantly rushing around between practices with my backpack, or smuggling a headlamp onto the bus back from a later soccer game to see my homework. So I’ve welcomed the feeling back as a long-lost friend. 

One thing I hadn’t previously noticed about such a scattered schedule is how it affects your output. But after a couple years of working 9-5 jobs where I’m productive at the same time every day, I can definitely recognize the difference now. At some times of the day the words flow through my fingers and onto the screen like lightning, impossible to control or predict. And other times I have to cajole each word through a 3-car pileup, carefully planning the route. 

This timing driven writers block feels entirely predictable in a sense- of course it will be harder to switch over to a writing mindset immediately following a full day of work. But if that’s the only time you have free that day, then it’s the only time you got. It seems to further highlight how much you have to prioritize creative work. You can’t just find a slot, you have to make a slot at a time that will be productive.
