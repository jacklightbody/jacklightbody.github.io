Normally I don’t enjoy like to drive. It feels like only negative things can happen, and I get stressed from constantly worrying about what the cars around me are doing, where I’m going, and what could happen. 

Driving on a long road trip feels different, likely because theres less on the mind. You rarely have to turn. Cars stick around long enough to become familiar friends rather than dangerous unknowns. And the scenery gradually shifts and changes.

With that kind of driving, it feels like I can strap in and go. I have to get through the first handful of miles to acclimate myself. But then the hours start to flow by. Especially if there are some good tunes cranking.

Driving certainly isn't the only experience where it’s infinitely more gratifying to do it for longer. But the trick is in persisting through that first unhappy twenty minutes to get into the flow state. Easier said than done. But always worth the effort.
