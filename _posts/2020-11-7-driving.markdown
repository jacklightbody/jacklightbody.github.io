Normally I don’t enjoy driving. I get stressed from constantly thinking about what others around me are doing, where I’m going, and what could happen. Basically I feels like only negative things can happen. 

But driving on a long road trip feels different. There’s just less on the mind. Turns rarely happen. Cars stick around long enough to become familiar. And the scenery gradually shifts and changes. It’s a much more relaxing experience. 

With that kind of driving, it feels like I can strap in and go and look at the clock a couple hours later. Especially if I get some good tunes cranking. 

I don’t think driving is the only experience where it’s infinitely more gratifying to do it for longer. But the trick is in persisting through that first unhappy twenty minutes to get into the flow state. Which can turn out to be quite a challenge.
