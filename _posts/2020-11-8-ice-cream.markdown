I have the same ice cream every birthday when I'm home. My mom dotingly makes a mint-chocolate chip that actually tastes like a fresh, herbal mint leaf. It's one of my favorite things to eat, and makes me question what exactly the toothpaste industry has convinced us is mint flavor.

But truthfully I also love mass-market brands in giant half gallon containers. I'm not too picky about my ice cream- as long as its rich and sugary, I'll probably eat it. 

Part of this is because even bad ice cream is still tasty. But even more, eating ice-cream is a comforting ritual for me. I eat it most days when I have no social plans, so it offers a moment of guaranteed future happiness to look forward to. It signals that my day is finished and I can relax.

That seems like the whole point of dessert. Even if you don't like the rest of the meal or the day or the company, theres something sweet to look forward to at the end of it. Something that'll cheer you up regardless.
