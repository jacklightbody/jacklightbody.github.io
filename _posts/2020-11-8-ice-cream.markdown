My mom has made ice cream for me every birthday I've been home for years. She makes a mint-chocolate chip that actually tastes like a fresh, herbal mint leaf, instead of what the toothpaste industry has convinced us is mint. It's ony of my all-time favorite foods. 

Truthfully, I could say something similar about mass-market brands in giant half gallon containers. I'm not too picky about my ice cream- as long as its rich and sugary, it'll probably taste good.  

But beyond the taste, eating ice cream is also a ritual of sorts for me. I eat it most days when I have no social plans, so it offers a moment of guaranteed future happiness to look forward to. It signals that my day is finished and I can destress.

Which seems like the whole point of dessert. Even if you don't like the rest of the meal or the day or the company, theres something sweet to look forward to at the end of it. Something that'll cheer you up regardless. Food is pretty cool that way.
