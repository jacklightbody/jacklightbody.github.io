Streets inform so much of a cities character. They dictate who is supposed to experience it and how they do so. Pedestrian only streets filled with restaurants and markets, narrow one-way alleys through looming buildings, and sweeping roads filled with traffic all invite different experiences.  The plans of some city planner long ago shaping how millions move and live.

One of my favorite things  in a new city is running with only a vague idea of where to go. I tend to let my eyes guide me, ducking down into little byways to the cities hidden heart. Or the garbage chutes. 

When I do go a bit astray, its never too hard to find my way again. There tend to be invisible gradients leading around the city, funnelling people towards bars and malls and capitalist America. Or rather, the gradients exist anyways, and capitalism ensures that there are things to do at the end of them. I always come back from these misadventures with a better idea of how the city fits together.

I'm certainly privileged to be able to explore in this way. I'm never seriously worried about my own safety, and I have enough of a sense of direction to not get seriously lost. But a toned down version of my experience is still achievable. Whether that be moving through a city by whimsy or just strolling down some new streets in your neighborhood.
