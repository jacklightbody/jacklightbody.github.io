So much of a cities character comes down to its streets. They dictate who is supposed to experience it and how they do so. Consider the difference between pedestrian only streets filled with restaurants and markets, narrow one-way alleys through looming buildings, and sweeping roads filled with traffic. All laid out by some city planner long ago, shaping how millions move and live.

One of my favorite things to do in a new city is to go for a run with only a vague idea of where to go. I tend to let my eyes guide me, ducking down into little byways to the cities hidden heart. Or the garbage chutes. Getting a little lost is invariably a great way to get a sense for how everything fits together.

When I do go a bit astray, its never to hard to find my way again. There tend to be invisible gradients leading around the city, funnelling people towards bars and malls and capitalist America. Or rather, the gradients exist anyways, and capitalism ensures that there are things to do at the end of them. 

I do recognize my privilege in being able to explore in this way. I'm never seriously worried about my own safety, and I have enough of a sense of direction to not get seriously lost. But I still think that it's possible to experience something of the same in a toned down version of the experience, letting whimsy guide you through a city, and not worrying terribly about where you end up.
