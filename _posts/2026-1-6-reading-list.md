I ended with 146 Books on the year. Here are my favorites across a few different categories:

* I loved the **detailed worldbuilding** in [Isles of the Emberdark](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210300489-isles-of-the-emberdark) by Brandon Sanderson. It follows a trapper and navigator in a dangerous Pacific Islands-like locale as he tries to save his people’s unique culture in the face of colonization and modernization. The premise might sound cheesy, but I couldn’t put down the book. If Sanderson isn’t quite your speed, I also really enjoyed the worldbuilding in [A Drop of Corruption](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213618143-a-drop-of-corruption) by Robert Jackson Bennett. It’s the second in the series, but it can be read as a standalone.  
* [Lonesome Dove](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256008.Lonesome_Dove) by Larry McMurtry was my favorite **historical fiction** read of the year. It has a slow pace, but is written exceptionally well and completely pulled me into a rich set of classic western storylines. If that’s too slow for you, [The Day of the Jackal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/540020.The_Day_of_the_Jackal) by Frederick Forsyth is a much faster paced spy novel that felt similarly authentic.  
* If you’re looking for a more **conceptual, contemplative story**, I really enjoyed [The Other Valley](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176450755-the-other-valley) by Scott Alexander Howard. It covers a unique take on time-travel where journeying to the next valley over means stepping 20 years into your own future or past and the implications that has on society. [The Afterlife Project](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216526874-the-afterlife-project) by Tim Weed also covers time travel in a unique way, and is written very similarly. Alternatively, [A Monster Calls](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25480342-a-monster-calls) by Patrick Ness is more of a young adult horror novel, but still scratched some of the same itch for me.  
* My favorite **magical academia** book was The Incandescent by Emily Tesh. It follows a professor at a magical English prep school, but focuses on the mundane details of day to day life with a background in the fantastical rather than something overtly magical like Harry Potter. Alternatively, [Blood Over Bright Haven](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208430658-blood-over-bright-haven) by M.L. Wang is less grounded in the day-to-day and more focused on magical research. [Death of the Author](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214329001-death-of-the-author) by Nnedi Okorafor doesn’t have any magic, but does capture the academic struggle.  
* For a **weird mind-bending book**, I devoured [Shades of Grey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2113260.Shades_of_Grey) by Jasper Fforde. It features a very odd caste (and magic?) system predicated around what colors people can see, and boasts an equally distinctive writing style. [The West Passage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195790798-the-west-passage) by Jared Pechacek made me feel a similar way, reminding me of a Russian-inspired Wizard of Oz.  
* I also read a bunch of **classic science fiction** with aliens, space battles, and all that jazz. [Salvation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34068552-salvation) by Peter Hamilton was my favorite and kicks off a great trilogy covering alien conspiracies, socialism, and gender identity. I’d also recommend [The Mercy of Gods](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201930181-the-mercy-of-gods) by James S.A. Corey and [The Forge of God](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64732.The_Forge_of_God) by Greg Bear in this genre.  
* Finally, if you’re just looking for an **easy, enjoyable read**, [Princess Floralinda and the Forty-Flight Tower](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54391767-princess-floralinda-and-the-forty-flight-tower) by Tamsyn Muir covers a Rapunzel-esque princess who has to save herself from the tower when all the princes aren’t up to the task. Or, for a more sci-fi angle, [Stars Uncharted](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36644837-stars-uncharted) by S. K. Dunstall is a light approachable space opera.

Happy reading\!
