    <p>My first year out of college was disorienting. For years I had experienced time in terms of well defined semesters, and measured my growth on a rubric defined by others like grades. But suddenly I was left adrift, without any natural markers.</p>

<p>I don’t think I even realized this for a long time. Until my lease came up, marking my 1 year anniversary in Seattle. And like all anniversaries, it forced me to look back and evaluate what I’d done. Moved to a new city, started a new job, made some friends. But after that first crazy month or two? Not much. All the wild nights out and tough hikes and tasty food blurred into each other, leaving a vague happy fog— but nothing concrete, no lasting growth.</p>

<p>Setting goals for myself has helped me remedy that. My first goal was to run a marathon. My second was to find a new job. Tangible, achievable things to build towards.</p>

<p>Becoming a better writer is my next goal. I’m a huge believer in the power of written words, and would love to produce as well as consume. Following the spirit of NaNoWriMo feels like a good place to start- writing every day for a month. We’ll see how it goes.</p>
