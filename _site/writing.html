        </h3><p>A startup runs on people in its early days. There are no rules, processes, or systems to help things get done. You want to ship some code? Cool, do it, no need for approval. Customer writes in with a complaint? Guess you have to get on the phone with them. Everyone is implicitly entrusted to do everything. They have to be.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>For most people, “Stubbornness” conjures images of a frustrating coworker digging in their heels on the smallest of compromises. They probably hated the experience.</p>

        </h3><p>I spent a week this summer hiking a <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/pacific-crest-trail-section-j-snoqualmie-pass-to-stevens-pass-east">75 mile stretch of the PCT</a> with a friend. We averaged ~18 miles a day, and would typically hike for 12 hours, get into camp around 7 at night, and fall into our sleeping bags shortly thereafter. On some nights I would’ve loved to have a bit more time to recover, but there simply wasn’t another way to cover that kind of mileage without long hours.</p>

            Losing (and Maintaining) Trust in Your Company
          </a>
        </h3><p>At any given time most people have a laundry-list of frustrations with their job. Yet even in the face of major disappointments like getting passed over for a promotion, they will often still feel positive about their work overall. Maybe they still really like their coworkers, or believe in the mission, or just enjoy the day-to-day mundanity enough that they’re ok with some frustration in the bigger picture.</p>
